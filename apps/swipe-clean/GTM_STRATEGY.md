Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I built SwipeClean to solve a problem we all have: too many photos, not enough time to organize them.

The idea is simple: swipe left to delete, swipe right to keep. Just like Tinder, but for your camera roll.

🎯 Key Features:
- Intuitive swipe interface
- Real-time stats (photos cleaned, storage saved)
- Safe deletion (goes to Recently Deleted folder)
- One-time $2.99 purchase (no subscription!)
- Undo function for mistakes

💡 Why I Built This:
I had 10,000+ photos on my phone. Cleaning them up the normal way would take hours. I wanted something fast, fun, and simple.

Built the entire app in 1 day using AI. (Wild times we live in!)

🎁 Special Offer:
First 100 Product Hunt users get it free! Comment "PH" below and I'll DM you a promo code.
