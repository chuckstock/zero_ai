## 🚨 Risks & Mitigation

### Technical Risks (LOW)
- **Performance with large libraries:** Mitigation = lazy loading ✅
- **IAP issues:** Mitigation = thorough sandbox testing
- **Permissions problems:** Mitigation = clear messaging, fallbacks

### Market Risks (MEDIUM)
- **Low conversion:** Mitigation = A/B test pricing, free limit
- **No viral content:** Mitigation = consistent posting, paid ads
- **Competition:** Mitigation = move fast, build brand

### Launch Risks (LOW)
- **App Store rejection:** Mitigation = follow guidelines, clear notes
- **No initial traction:** Mitigation = multi-channel approach
- **Bad reviews:** Mitigation = beta test thoroughly, fix bugs fast

## 💡 Key Insights

### AI-Native Development Changes Everything
- **Old thinking:** "This will take 6 months and $100K"
- **New reality:** "Built in 1 day for $0"
- **Implication:** Build more, analyze less. Ship and iterate.

### Portfolio Approach is Optimal
- With near-zero cost, should build 3-5 apps simultaneously
- One hit pays for all others
- Reduces risk through diversification
- Validates in market vs. analysis paralysis

### Distribution > Development
- Development is no longer the constraint
- Marketing and distribution are the real challenges
- GTM strategy more valuable than perfect code
- Launch fast, iterate based on user feedback
